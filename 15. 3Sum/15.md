# Question
Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.


Constraints:

- 3 <= nums.length <= 3000
- -105 <= nums[i] <= 105
# Intuition
The intuition behind this is that we want to walk the array, then for each number we want to check whether two other numbers exist within the array whose total with the current number will equal zero. So essentially, we can walk the array and then use a two pointer approach to compare all the numbers. But that would be inefficient because for every number we would have to check every number against every other number. We can shorten the operation by sorting the array. We then walk the array, start at the next number and the last number and we check where in relation to zero the total is. If it's too small, we can move the left pointer up, if its too big we move the right pointer down. If the pointers ever cross without pointing to a zero total, we know that 0 isn't possible with the current number so we can move on.


# Complexity
The naive brute-force method would be o(n\*\*3) as we'd have to have three loops all of which go over the array. The solution is o(n\*\*2) as we still need to do a comparison against every other number combination. Sorting is o(n logn) but it gets dominated by o(n\*\* 2) so the overall complexity remains the same at o(n\*\*2).
