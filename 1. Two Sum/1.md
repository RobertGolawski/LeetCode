# Question

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

Constraints:

- 2 <= nums.length <= 104
- -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
- -109 <= target <= 109
- Only one valid answer exists.

# Intuition

If we have two numbers which add up to a target, it means that if we know the target and one of the numbers we can check for the existence of the other number that's needed to make up the target. With that in mind, the naive brute-force solution would be to look at the current number, subtract it from the target then iterate over the rest of the array to see if its present. However, a better solution is to iterate through the array and check if the difference is present in a hash map. If it's compliment is not present, then we add the current number to the map with the index as its value since we care about the indices.

# Complexity

The naive solution would end up being o(n\*\*2) time complexity as it could potentially have to iterate through all the numbers for every number, but it would have a o(1) space complexity as it does just use the space that's already allocated for the array. The hash map solution is a o(n) time complexity but also o(n) space complexity because the hash map might end up being n key/value pairs long.
