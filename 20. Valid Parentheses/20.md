# Question

Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

1) Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2) Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
3) Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length <= 104
- s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'.

# Intuition

The idea here is that we want to make sure we have a matching pair, and that means that any closing bracket will have to be matched with its opening bracket. Which means we can keep track of the latest opening bracket and when we run into a closing one we can see if that was the bracket type which was last opened. If it was, we can get rid of that bracket pair otherwise we just return false. Typical data structure for that is a stack, as its first in last out, aka last in first out, which is perfect for checking the most recently added opening bracket.

# Complexity

Time and space complexity are o(n) as we walk through the string once and have to add potentially 1/2 * n of brackets to a stack but of course we ignore the modifiers so its just o(n).
