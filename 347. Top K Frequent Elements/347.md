# Question

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the `k` most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
- `k` is in the range `[1, the number of unique elements in the array]`.
- It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.

# Intuition

The naive approach would involve creating a frequency map for each integer and then using a heap or priority queue to sort elements based on their frequencies. While this works, a more optimal solution leverages the frequency map but then instantiates an array of arrays (often called "buckets") of size `len(nums) + 1`. This "bucket array" is used to group numbers based on their frequency.

The algorithm works as follows:

1.  Create a frequency map to count the occurrences of each number.
2.  Create a "bucket array" (`freqList`) of size `len(nums) + 1`. Each index in this array represents a frequency.
3.  Iterate through the frequency map, and for each number, append it to the bucket in `freqList` that corresponds to its frequency. For example, if the number `7` appears 3 times, it would be appended to `freqList[3]`.
4.  Iterate through `freqList` _backwards_ (from the highest frequency to the lowest). As you iterate, collect the numbers from each bucket until you have collected `k` numbers.

The size of the bucket array is `len(nums) + 1` to handle the scenario where a single number appears `len(nums)` times (i.e., all elements in the input array are the same). In this case, that number would have a frequency of `len(nums)`, and we need an index in `freqList` to store it. We use the index as a direct mapping of frequency to the bucket. Since we will have nothing in the 0th bucket, the extra spot in the array exists to avoid out of bounds exceptions.

# Complexity

- **Naive Approach:**
  - _Time Complexity:_ `O(n log n)` (dominated by the heap/priority queue sorting).
  - _Space Complexity:_ `O(n)` (for the frequency map).
- **Optimal Approach:**
  - _Time Complexity:_ `O(n)` (for iterating through the arrays and frequency map).
  - _Space Complexity:_ `O(n)` (for the frequency map and the bucket array).
