# Question
Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 104
- -104 < nums[i], target < 104
- All the integers in nums are unique.
- nums is sorted in ascending order.

# Intuition

The idea behind binary search is to use a sorted array and start with two pointers, one on the far left and one on the far right then find the mid point between them, once the mid point is found we can compare the item at that index to the target number. Depending on whether the element at the index is greater or lesser than the target we can move either the left pointer to the mid point or the right pointer to the mid point and repeat the steps. Once the pointers cross, we know that the target doesn't exist in the array so we can quit our loop.

# Complexity

Because at each step we cut the remaining elements in half, the complexity is O(log n).
