# Question

Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

Constraints:

- 1 <= strs.length <= 104
- 0 <= strs[i].length <= 100
- strs[i] consists of lowercase English letters.

# Intuition

This question is an enhanced version of valid anagram. The idea is to find every combination of letters for all strings and group them together by letter count. My initial thought was to sort the string and store it as a key in a map, then sort every string and compare the sorted version to the keys in the map. If the key exists, then add the unsorted version of the string to the value held in the map, which would be an array of strings. Once all strings have been walked through, walk through the keys and append the value to an array of arrays of strings. But that introduces the need for sorting, so we can use the same optimisation as the one in the valid anagram. Get an int array representation (letter frequency array) of the string to use as a key then store the raw string as a value.

# Complexity

The naive solution (sorting then comparing) would require a sort which is o(n logn) whereas doing the letter freq array is o(n). Space complexity would be o(n) in both cases as they're both creating a map and a new array as the answer.
