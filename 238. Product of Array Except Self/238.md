# Question

Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

Constraints:

- 2 <= nums.length <= 105
- -30 <= nums[i] <= 30
- The input is generated such that answer[i] is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

**Follow up added for context in complexity section**
Follow up: Can you solve the problem in O(1) extra space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)

# Intuition

If the division operation was allowed, we could just walk through the whole array and find the product then walk through it again and divide the product by the current element, but alas its not. But this gives us a hint, we can walk through the array twice and find the product to the left of the current element on the first go and store it in an array then walk through it a second time backwards to find the product of everything to the left and multiply it by everything to the right of the element giving us the product of everything both sides of the current element.

# Complexity

The solution has a time complexity of o(n) as we just walk the array twice, and a space complexity of o(1) as the answer array doesn't count as a part of the space complexity (as per the question), but technically we're not doing it in place so TECHNICALLY its o(n) if not for the stipulation in the question because we're creating a second array for the answer.
